# TBTG
A simple Turn Based Tactics Game with randomly generated levels made in Delphi.

A lot of the game's constants can be tweaked in GameValues

Reading Delphi:

Delphi is an IDE with a visual form designer, so without actually owning Delphi and being able to open the project it can be a bit hard to read.

The .pas files are the main code parts, though they often rely on objects in the forms, defined in the .fmx files.

A copy of the compiled executable is in the fittingly named Executable folder.
